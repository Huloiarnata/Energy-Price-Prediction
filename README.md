# Energy Price Forecaster (Ongoing)

## Project Overview

**Objective:** Build a time series forecasting model using ARIMA to predict upcoming energy prices and notify users when prices are low, allowing them to optimize their energy consumption for cost savings.

## GitHub Repository Description

This repository contains code and resources for an ongoing Energy Price Forecaster powered by an ARIMA model. Users can leverage this tool to make informed decisions about their energy usage and potentially save on their energy bills.

## Project Implementation Steps

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather historical energy price data from reliable sources. This data should include timestamps and corresponding energy prices.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers.
   - Convert timestamps to a suitable time series format.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Perform EDA to understand the data's patterns, seasonality, and trends.
   - Visualize the data to identify any recurring patterns.

4. **Model Selection:**
   - Choose the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series forecasting. You can use libraries like `statsmodels` in Python.

5. **Model Training:**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets, ensuring that the testing data covers future time periods.
   - Train the ARIMA model on the training data.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Use the testing data to assess how well the model predicts future energy prices.

7. **Notification System:**
   - Implement a notification system to alert users when energy prices are forecasted to be low.
   - You can use email notifications, push notifications, or any other preferred communication method.

8. **Deployment:**
   - Host the forecasting model on a server or cloud platform for ongoing predictions.
   - Schedule regular updates to keep the model current.

9. **User Interface (Optional):**
   - Develop a user-friendly interface (web or mobile app) for users to access real-time energy price forecasts and receive notifications.

10. **Documentation:**
    - Create detailed documentation explaining how to use the system, interpret notifications, and customize alert thresholds.

11. **GitHub Repository:**
    - Organize your code, data, and documentation in a GitHub repository.
    - Include a README.md file with instructions for users and contributors.
    - Share relevant visualizations and model performance metrics.

12. **Continuous Improvement:**
    - Continuously monitor and evaluate the model's performance and update it as needed.
    - Encourage user feedback for improvements and feature requests.

13. **Security and Privacy:**
    - Ensure the security and privacy of user data, especially if user information is collected for notifications.

14. **Licensing:**
    - Choose an appropriate open-source license for your repository to specify how others can use your code.

15. **Community Engagement:**
    - Encourage collaboration and contributions from the open-source community to enhance the project's functionality and reliability.

By following these steps and maintaining an active development cycle, you can create a valuable tool for users to optimize their energy consumption and minimize costs while contributing to the open-source community.
